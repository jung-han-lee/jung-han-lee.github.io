#Machine Learning : Neural Network

###1. Neural Networks : Neurons and Activation Functions

A neural network is a network of neurons connected together.

Each neuron in a neural network has associated with it a scalar-valued _activation function_ $f_a(\cdot)$, along with a weight $w$ and a bias $b$.
