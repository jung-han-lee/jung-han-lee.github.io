## Overview :
In this project, I wrote queries against Postgres using baseball database.

#Getting started :

First, open a terminal and start the docker container:
```
docker start -ai cs186
```
Second, I connected to the baseball database that is pre-loaded in the docker image.
```
ubuntu@39225f25ec54:~$ psql baseball
```

## Database
The database is comprised of the following main tables:
```
People - Player names, date of birth (DOB), and biographical info
Batting - batting statistics
Pitching - pitching statistics
Fielding - fielding statistics
```

And supplementing tables are as follows:
```
AllStarFull - All-Star appearance
HallofFame - Hall of Fame voting data
Managers - managerial statistics
Teams - yearly stats and standings
BattingPost - post-season batting statistics
PitchingPost - post-season pitching statistics
TeamFranchises - franchise information
FieldingOF - outfield position data
FieldingPost- post-season fielding data
ManagersHalf - split season data for managers
TeamsHalf - split season data for teams
Salaries - player salary data
SeriesPost - post-season series information
AwardsManagers - awards won by managers
AwardsPlayers - awards won by players
AwardsShareManagers - award voting for manager awards
AwardsSharePlayers - award voting for player awards
Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at
Schools - list of colleges that players attended
CollegePlaying - list of players and the colleges they attended
```

## Writing Quearies

* Basics

+ In the people table, find the namefirst, namelast and birthyear for all players with weight greater than 300 pounds.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q1i(namefirst, namelast, birthyear)
AS
  SELECT namefirst, namelast, birthyear
  from people
  where weight>300 ;
  ```

+ Find the namefirst, namelast and birthyear of all players whose namefirst field contains a space.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q1ii(namefirst, namelast, birthyear)
AS
  SELECT namefirst, namelast, birthyear
  From people
  Where length(namefirst)!=length(replace(namefirst, ' ',''));
```

+ From the people table, group together players with the same birthyear, and report the birthyear, average height, and number of players for each birthyear. Order the results by birthyear in ascending order.

Note: some birthyears have no players; your answer can simply skip those years. In some other years, you may find that all the players have a NULL height value in the dataset (i.e. height IS NULL); your query should return NULL for the height in those years.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q1iii(birthyear, avgheight, count)
AS
  SELECT birthyear, avg(height), count(*)
  from people
  group by birthyear
  order by birthyear;
```

+ Following the results of Part iii, now only include groups with an average height > 70. Again order the results by birthyear in ascending order.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q1iv(birthyear, avgheight, count)
AS
  SELECT birthyear, avg(height), count(*)
  from people
  group by birthyear
  having avg(height)>70
  order by birthyear;
```

* Hall of Fame Schools

+ Find the namefirst, namelast, playerid and yearid of all people who were successfully inducted into the Hall of Fame in descending order of yearid.

Note: a player with id drewj.01 is listed as having failed to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, but does not show up in the people table. Your query may assume that all players inducted into the Hall of Fame appear in the people table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q2i(namefirst, namelast, playerid, yearid)
AS
SELECT p.namefirst, p.namelast, p.playerid, h.yearid
from people p inner join HallOfFame h on p.playerid = h.playerid
where h.inducted = 'Y' order by h.yearid desc;
```
+ Find the people who were successfully inducted into the Hall of Fame and played in college at a school located in the state of California. For each person, return their namefirst, namelast, playerid, schoolid, and yearid in descending order of yearid. Break ties on yearid by schoolid, playerid (ascending). (For this question, yearid refers to the year of induction into the Hall of Fame).

Note: a player may appear in the results multiple times (once per year in a college in California).

```sql
CREATE VIEW q2ii(namefirst, namelast, playerid, schoolid, yearid)
AS
SELECT  p.namefirst, p.namelast, p.playerid, s.schoolid, h.yearid
from people p inner join HallOfFame h on p.playerid = h.playerid
    inner join CollegePlaying c on p.playerid=c.playerid
    inner join Schools s on c.schoolid=s.schoolid
where s.schoolState = 'CA' and h.inducted = 'Y' order by h.yearid desc, schoolid, playerid;
```

+ Find the playerid, namefirst, namelast and schoolid of all people who were successfully inducted into the Hall of Fame -- whether or not they played in college. Return people in descending order of playerid. Break ties on playerid by schoolid (ascending). (Note: schoolid will be NULL if they did not play in college.)

```sql
CREATE VIEW q2iii(playerid, namefirst, namelast, schoolid)
AS
SELECT p.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast, c.schoolid
from people p left outer join CollegePlaying c on p.playerid = c.playerid
    inner join HallOfFame h on p.playerid=h.playerid
where h.inducted='Y'
order by p.playerid desc, c.schoolid;
```

* SaberMetrics

+ Find the playerid, namefirst, namelast, yearid and single-year slg (Slugging Percentage) of the players with the 10 best annual Slugging Percentage recorded over all time. For statistical significance, only include players with more than 50 at-bats in the season. Order the results by slg descending, and break ties by yearid, playerid (ascending).

Baseball note: Slugging Percentage is not provided in the database; it is computed according to a simple formula you can calculate from the data in the database.

SQL note: You should compute slg properly as a floating point number---you'll need to figure out how to convince SQL to do this!

```sql
CREATE VIEW q3i(playerid, namefirst, namelast, yearid, slg)
AS
SELECT p.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast, b.yearid, (b.h-b.h2b-b.h3b-b.hr+2*(b.h2b)+3*(b.h3b)+4*(b.hr))::float/b.AB as slg
from people p inner join Batting b on p.playerid = b.playerid
where b.AB>50
order by slg desc, b.yearid, p.playerid limit 10;
```

+ Following the results from Part i, find the playerid, namefirst, namelast and lslg (Lifetime Slugging Percentage) for the players with the top 10 Lifetime Slugging Percentage. Note that the database only gives batting information broken down by year; you will need to convert to total information across all time (from the earliest date recorded up to the last date recorded) to compute lslg.

Order the results by lslg descending, and break ties by playerid (ascending order).

NOTE: Make sure that you only include players with more than 50 at-bats across their lifetime.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q3ii(playerid, namefirst, namelast, lslg)
AS
  SELECT playerid, namefirst, namelast, (sum_h-sum_h2b-sum_h3b-sum_hr+2*(sum_h2b)+3*(sum_h3b)+4*(sum_hr))::float/sum_AB as lslg
  from(Select p.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast, sum(b.h) as sum_h, sum(b.h2B) as sum_h2b, sum(b.h3B) as sum_h3b, sum(b.hr) as sum_hr, sum(b.AB) as sum_AB
      from people p, Batting b where p.playerid=b.playerid group by p.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast) as temp
  where sum_AB>50
  order by lslg desc, playerid limit 10;
```

+ Find the namefirst, namelast and Lifetime Slugging Percentage (lslg) of batters whose lifetime slugging percentage is higher than that of San Francisco favorite Willie Mays. You may include Willie Mays' playerid in your query (mayswi01), but you may not include his slugging percentage -- you should calculate that as part of the query. (Test your query by replacing mayswi01 with the playerid of another player -- it should work for that player as well! We may do the same in the autograder.)

NOTE: Make sure that you still only include players with more than 50 at-bats across their lifetime.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q3iii(namefirst, namelast, lslg)
AS
with temp2 (playerid, namefirst, namelast, lslg) as
(
SELECT playerid, namefirst, namelast, (sum_h-sum_h2b-sum_h3b-sum_hr+2*(sum_h2b)+3*(sum_h3b)+4*(sum_hr))::float/sum_AB as lslg
from(Select p.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast, sum(b.h) as sum_h, sum(b.h2B) as sum_h2b, sum(b.h3B) as sum_h3b, sum(b.hr) as sum_hr, sum(b.AB) as sum_AB
  from people p, Batting b where p.playerid=b.playerid group by p.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast) as temp
where sum_AB>50
)
Select namefirst, namelast, lslg
from temp2
where lslg > all(SELECT lslg from temp2 where playerid='mayswi01')
order by namefirst;
```

* Salaries

+ Find the yearid, min, max, average and standard deviation of all player salaries for each year recorded, ordered by yearid in ascending order.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q4i(yearid, min, max, avg, stddev)
AS
  SELECT yearid, min(salary), max(salary), avg(salary), stddev(salary)
  from Salaries
  group by yearid
  order by yearid;
```
+ For salaries in 2016, compute a histogram. Divide the salary range into 10 equal bins from min to max, with binids 0 through 9, and count the salaries in each bin. Return the binid, low and high boundaries for each bin, as well as the number of salaries in each bin, with results sorted from smallest bin to largest.

Note: binid 0 corresponds to the lowest salaries, and binid 9 corresponds to the highest. The ranges are left-inclusive (i.e. [low, high)) -- so the high value is excluded. For example, if bin 2 has a high value of 100000, salaries of 100000 belong in bin 3, and bin 3 should have a low value of 100000.

Note: The high value for bin 9 may be inclusive).

Note: generate_series may be useful for this part. The documentation can be found at https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-srf.html.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q4ii(binid, low, high, count)
AS
  with min_max (min_s, max_s, range) as (
    SELECT min(salary) as min_s, max(salary) as max_s, (max(salary)-min(salary))/10 as range
    from Salaries
    where yearid='2016'
  ), bins (binid) as (
    SELECT width_bucket(salary, min_s, max_s+1, 10)-1 as binid, count(*) as num
    from Salaries, min_max
    where yearid='2016'
    group by binid
  )
  SELECT binid, min_s+range*binid as low, min_s+range*(binid+1) as high, num as count
  from bins, min_max
  order by binid;
```

+ Now let's compute the Year-over-Year change in min, max and average player salary. For each year with recorded salaries after the first, return the yearid, mindiff, maxdiff, and avgdiff with respect to the previous year. Order the output by yearid in ascending order. (You should omit the very first year of recorded salaries from the result.)

```sql
CREATE VIEW q4iii(yearid, mindiff, maxdiff, avgdiff)
AS
with  s as (SELECT yearid, min(salary), max(salary), avg(salary), stddev(salary)
  from Salaries
  group by yearid
  order by yearid
)
SELECT s.yearid, s.min - l.min as mindiff, s.max-l.max as maxdiff, s.avg-l.avg as avfdiff
from s inner join s as l on s.yearid-1 = l.yearid
order by s.yearid;
```

+ In 2001, the max salary went up by over $6 million. Write a query to find the players that had the max salary in 2000 and 2001. Return the playerid, namefirst, namelast, salary and yearid for those two years. If multiple players tied for the max salary in a year, return all of them.

Note on notation: you are computing a relational variant of the argmax for each of those two years.

```sql
CREATE VIEW q4iv(playerid, namefirst, namelast, salary, yearid)
AS
  SELECT p.playerid, namefirst, namelast, s.salary ,s.yearid
  from people p inner join Salaries s on p.playerid = s.playerid inner join
      (SELECT yearid, max(salary) as max_s
      from Salaries
      where yearid = '2001' or yearid='2000'
      group by yearid) as temp on s.yearid = temp.yearid  and s.salary = temp.max_s
  order by s.yearid;
```

+ Each team has at least 1 All Star and may have multiple. For each team in the year 2016, give the teamid and diffAvg (the difference between the team's highest paid all-star's salary and the team's lowest paid all-star's salary). Order your final solution by teamid. NOTE: Due to some discrepancies in the database, please draw your team names from the All-Star table (so use allstarfull.teamid in the SELECT statement for this).

```sql
CREATE VIEW q4v(team, diffAvg) AS
  SELECT a.teamid, max(s.salary)-min(s.salary) as diffAvg
  from Salaries s inner join AllstarFull a on s.playerid = a.playerid and s.yearid = a.yearid
  where s.yearid = '2016'
  group by a.teamid
  order by a.teamid;
```
