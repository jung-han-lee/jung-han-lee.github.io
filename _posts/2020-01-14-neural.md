#Machine Learning : Neural Network

##1. Neural Networks : Neurons and Activation Functions

A neural network is a network of neurons connected together.

Each neuron in a neural network has associated with it a scalar-valued _activation function_ $f_a(\cdot)$, along with a weight $w$ and a bias $b$.

The neuron represented in the figure above takes as its input a scalar  ùë• , and returns as the output

$$f_1(x,\color{green}{w},\color{blue}{b}) = f_{a}(\color{green}{w}\,\color{black}x + \color{blue}{b}).$$

Here $w$ is the weight of the input _edge_ to the neuron.
